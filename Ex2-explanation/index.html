                       Cryptocurrency is an internet-based medium of exchange which uses cryptographical functions to 
                       conduct financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies leverage blockchain technology to gain decentralization, 
                       transparency, and immutability.

                        To realize digital cash you need a payment network with accounts, balances, and transaction. That‘s easy 
                        to understand. One major problem every payment network has to solve is to prevent the so-called double 
                        spending: to prevent that one entity spends the same amount twice. Usually, this is done by a central 
                        server who keeps record about the balances.

                        Few people know, but cryptocurrencies emerged as a side product of another invention. <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, 
                        the unknown inventor of Bitcoin, the first and still most important cryptocurrency, never intended to invent a 
                        currency. 
                        <br>
                        In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said he developed “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.“  
                        <br>
                        His goal was to invent something; many people failed to create before digital cash.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The single most important part of Satoshi‘s invention was that he found a way to build a decentralized digital cash 
                        system. In the nineties, there have been many attempts to create digital money, but they all failed. 
                        <br>
                        After seeing all the centralized attempts fail, Satoshi tried to build a digital cash system without a central entity. Like a Peer-to-Peer network for file sharing.
                        <br>
                        This decision became the birth of cryptocurrency. They are the missing piece Satoshi found to realize digital cash. 
                        The reason why is a bit technical and complex, but if you get it, you‘ll know more about cryptocurrencies than most 
                        people do. So, let‘s try to make it as easy as possible:
                        <br>
                        To realize digital cash you need a payment network with accounts, balances, and transaction. That‘s easy to understand. 
                        One major problem every payment network has to solve is to prevent the so-called double spending: to prevent that one 
                        entity spends the same amount twice. Usually, this is done by a central server who keeps record about the balances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a decentralized network , <strong> you don‘t have this server. So you need every single entity 
                            of the network to do this job. Every peer in the network needs to have a list with all transactions 
                            to check if future transactions are valid or an attempt to double spend. 
                        </strong> <br>
                        But how can these entities keep a <strong> consensus about these records?</strong>  
                        <br>
                        If the peers of the network disagree about only one single, minor balance, everything is broken. They need 
                        an absolute consensus. Usually, you take, again, a central authority to declare the correct state of balances. 
                        But how can you achieve consensus without a central authority?

                        What is cryptocurrency mining?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Principally everybody can be a miner. Since a decentralized network has no authority to delegate 
                        this task, a cryptocurrency needs some kind of mechanism to prevent one ruling party from abusing 
                        it. Imagine someone creates thousands of peers and spreads forged transactions. The system would 
                        break immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, Satoshi set the rule that the miners need to invest some work of their computers to qualify for 
                        this task. In fact, they have to find a hash – a product of a cryptographic function – that connects
                         the new block with its predecessor. This is called the Proof-of-Work. In Bitcoin, it is based on the
                          SHA 256 Hash algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoins can only be created if miners solve a cryptographic puzzle. Since the difficulty of this puzzle
                         increases the amount of computer power the whole miner’s invest, there is only a specific amount of 
                         cryptocurrency token that can be created in a given amount of time. This is part of the consensus no peer 
                         in the network can break.
